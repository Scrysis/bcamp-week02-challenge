But while our eager pup would love to share all of her creations, she's a little shy, and is only willing to share just one.  That particular one is the Work-scheduler, and is featured at the top of the work presentation section.  Click on the image and the web app page will open in a completely new window.

And while all of the rest of the carded images are stock images standing in as fake web apps, please take a moment to marvel and appreciate the beautiful faded transitions as you move your mouse on and off the pictures on screen.

And finally, we have something for those of you looking at the site with a tablet or phone!  Modified after 1050 pixel width, and again at 600px width, the orientation becomes more vertical, fitting more into your screen.
